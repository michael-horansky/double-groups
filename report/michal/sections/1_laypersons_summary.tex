The title of the layperson's summary: "Breaking the Symmetry, or, When Crystals Are Almost Perfect". It will focus firstly on the role of symmetries in selection rules and secondly on the overlap decomposition as a quantifier of what we mean by \textit{approximate}. Technicalities such as double groups or growth of QDs shall be omitted for brevity (although \cite{hexagon} will be discussed as a motivator for the perturbative approach).
