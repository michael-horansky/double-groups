\section{Discussions of theory employed}

\subsection{The InGaAs pyramidal quantum dot} \label{sec:growth}
A brief description of the growth process as employed by Karlsson, Pelucchi etc. A discussion of \cite{hexagon} and its arguments for the true shape. A review of effects that alter the shape (and hence the symmetry) of a quantum dot, including strain and other mechanical effects.

\subsection{Exciton complexes and double groups} \label{sec:exciton_theory}
A theoretical description of exciton complexes, the decomposition of their wavefunctions into a periodic function and an envelope function, and a model of the enevlope function's "effective Hamiltonian" as a box (of a non-rectangular shape) potential with particles interacting via Coulomb interaction and magnetic momenta interaction (here we justify a first-quantization approach by asserting non-relativistic effective speeds). Total angular momentum is shown to be a good quantum number and its treatment within the full rotoinversion $SU(2)\otimes C_i$ group is described.

NOTES:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the semi-classical tight-binding model, we consider excited fermions in the nanocrystal as "particles in a box", confined to a spatial domain in which they move freely, and the effects of the atomic structure on the free particles are encoded in the effective mass parameter.
\item We can use the effective mass formulation because the nanocrystals are big enough to have a band-structure (cite Dresselhaus).
\item The full wavefunction $\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)$ is decomposed into an envelope function $\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)$ and a periodic function $U\left(\vec{r}\right)$, where $U\left(\vec{r}-\vec{r}_n\right)=U\left(\vec{r}\right)$. Therefore
$$\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)=\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)U\left(\vec{r}\right)$$
and therefore the character of the wavefunction under a rotation $\hat{R}$ is
$$\chi^{\left(\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)\right)}\left(\hat{R}\right)=\chi^{\left(\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)\right)}\left(\hat{R}\right)\chi^{\left(U\left(\vec{r}\right)\right)}\left(\hat{R}\right)$$
Due to energy constraints, we expect the envelop functions to be dominated by the ground state levels, which transform according to the identity irrep. The character of the periodic function is then given by taking the toal angular momentum eigenstate $j$ and subduing it into the spatial point group of the quantum dot (which governs also the boundary conditions of the envelope function).
\item Luttinger-Kohn model to justify free-electrons and effective masses at the $\Gamma$ point (only there!!!!!).
\end{itemize}

TEXT

The physical phenomenon which is subject to our study is photoluminiscence. Since this mechanism does not have the QDs in a laboratory ensemble interact or "communicate", we can formulate a theoretical model of photoluminiscence on a singular QD. An external electromagnetic field in the form of a light-beam interacts with the QD in a non-resonant way (as for not to favour a single excited state), which promotes electrons into the conduction band and holes into the valence bands (since there are typically two valence bands at the band edge, which touch at $\Gamma$). The population of excited electrons and different characteristics of holes is called an exciton complex. Exciton complexes decay into lower-occupancy exciton complexes via electron-hole recombination, which produces bright emission lines in the photoluminiscence spectrum. These lines are sharp and occur at fixed frequencies corresponding to the energy level differences, and the theoretical description of their spectrum is the ultimate goal of this work.

In the Karlsson \textit{et al.} system, the light-beam is a laser with a spot size of $\SI{1}{\micro\metre}$, power in the range $25$--$\SI{750}{\nano\watt}$, and wavelength of $\SI{532}{\nano\metre}$. The semiconductor nanocrystal has a direct band-gap at $\Gamma$. The excitons with resolvable emissions have low occupancy numbers (3 or fewer of any of the three fermions--electrons, light holes, and heavy holes). Since the number of fermions excited on a single band is smaller than the number of states available on the band by many orders of magnitude (GIVE ROUGH ESTIMATE), we approximate the exciton complexes as living on $\Gamma$, i.e. each excited fermion having zero crystal momentum.

Clearly, the phenomenon of photoluminiscence and its behaviour is wholly described by the specific wavefunctions of the exciton complexes. However, finding the wavefunctions and the matrix elements of interaction operators is a near-impossible task and is not viable to make predictions about the spectrum of the quantum dot. However, we can make multiple very strong qualitative predictions (mainly regarding degeneracies of energy levels and selection rules) by using purely symmetry arguments, using the formalism of group theory. To employ group theory, we must first identify the physical symmetries of our quantum dot.

\subsubsection{Envelope function method}
The following approach is informed by that developed by Burt (1999), \cite{envelope_fundamentals}. Let us consider a QD with a single excited electron which is promoted to the conduction band (the following easily generalises to holes promoted to valence bands). Disregarding the spin component of its wavefunction for simplicity, we decompose the electron's spatial wavefunction $\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)$ into plane-waves:
\begin{equation}
\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)=\int\dd\vec{k} \tilde{\Psi}\left(\vec{k}\right)\exp{i\vec{k}\vdot\vec{r}}
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{\Psi}\left(\vec{k}\right)$ is the Fourier transform of $\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)$. We now decompose the integral domain into the first Brillouin zone (B.Z.) summed over the set of reciprocal lattice vectors $G$:
\begin{equation}
\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)=\sum_{\vec{g}\in G}\int_{\vec{k}\in\text{1st B.Z.}}\dd\vec{k} \tilde{\Psi}\left(\vec{k}+\vec{g}\right)\exp{i\left(\vec{k}+\vec{g}\right)\vdot\vec{r}}
\end{equation}
Note that $G$ is equivalent to the set of wave-vectors of plane waves periodic on the Bravais lattice. Therefore, we can choose a set of basis functions $U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)$ periodic on the Bravais lattice like so:
\begin{eqnarray}
U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)&=&\sum_{\vec{g}\in G}u_{n}\left(\vec{g}\right)\exp{i\vec{g}\vdot\vec{r}}\\
U_n\left(\vec{r}+\vec{r}_B\right)&=&\sum_{\vec{g}\in G}u_{n}\left(\vec{g}\right)\exp{i\vec{g}\vdot\vec{r}}\exp{i\vec{g}\vdot\vec{r}_B}=U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vec{r}_B\in R$ is a lattice vector and $u_n\left(\vec{g}\right)$ are the coefficients of the decomposition of $U_n$ into reciprocal lattice plane waves, typically chosen such that $U_n$ are orthonormal. Then, inverting this decomposition, we obtain
\begin{equation}
\exp{i\vec{g}\vdot r} = \sum_n u_n\left(\vec{g}\right)^*U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)
\end{equation}
which allows us to decompose the original wavefunction into a sum of the orthonormal basis vectors $U_n$ and their envelope functions $\Upsilon_n$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)&=&\sum_n \Upsilon_n\left(\vec{r}\right)U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)\\
\Upsilon_n\left(\vec{r}\right)&=&\sum_{\vec{g}\in G}\int_{\vec{k}\in\text{B.Z.}}\dd\vec{k}u_n\left(\vec{g}\right)^*\tilde{\Psi}\left(\vec{k}+\vec{g}\right)\exp{i\vec{k}\vdot\vec{r}}
\end{eqnarray}
Now, we choose $U_n\left(\vec{r}\right)$ to represent the band-edge wavestates in the bulk structure. Using a tight-binding model with spin-orbit coupling, these wavestates can be labelled by three quantum numbers: total angular momentum $j$, its projection onto the $z$-axis $j_z$, and the orbital energy excitation $\varepsilon_n$, which we assume to be in the ground state in our system due to energy occupancy statistics (as we expect the population of states other than in the ground state to be negligible for a low-power light-source). Furthermore, the quantum number $j$ is determined by the orbital angular momentum $l$, which is given by the electron configuration in each specific band, and the spin $s=1/2$ determined for electrons and electron holes by their fundamental properties.

Photonic nanostructures can, on a small scale, cease to posses a standard band-structure, instead featuring e.g. flat bands. Dresselhaus \textit{et al.} (2007) quotes the number of Bravais lattice cells below which this occurs to be in the order of $10^2$ \cite[p. 213]{dresselhaus_condensed_matter}. Our QDs have volumes typically higher than $\SI{100}{\nano\metre\cubed}$ \cite[p. 2]{karlsson_2010}, which corresponds to the number of unit cells in the order of $10^3$. Hence we can reasonably expect our system to posses a band structure. This has two consequences to our envelope function model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The envelope function $\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)$ is varying slowly enough for it to have an approximately defined crystal momentum. As discussed in \ref{sec:exciton_theory}, we assume $k\approx 0$.
\item The wavefunction $\Psi\left(\vec{r}\right)$ of a single excited fermion approximately corresponds to a single state on the excited band of the infinite bulk crystal band structure. In other words, there exists a basis vector $U_n$ such that for all other basis vectors $U_m, m\neq n$, their contribution to the wavefunction is negligible.
\end{enumerate}
Labelling the single contributing basis vector by the quantum numbers $l, s, j, j_z$, we can express the wavefunction of a single excited fermion as
\begin{equation}
\braket{\vec{r}}{\Psi}=\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)\braket{\vec{r}}{l, s=1/2, j, j_z}
\end{equation}
As discussed in Burt (1992) \cite[p. 6656]{envelope_equation}, we can write down the effective Hamiltonian for the envelope function, which yields the corresponding Schr√∂dinger equation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{H}_\Upsilon &=& -\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\nabla\vdot\frac{1}{m^*\left(\vec{r}\right)}\nabla + E_0\\
\hat{H}_\Upsilon \Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)&=& E\Upsilon\left(\vec{r}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
where $E_0$ is the band-edge energy. Now, in a parabolic Taylor expansion of the bands about $\Gamma$, we state that around the $\Gamma$ point the effective mass $m^*$ is constant. We now see that the Schr√∂dinger equation reduces to the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:single_envelope_function}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m^*}\nabla^2 \Upsilon = (E-E_0)\Upsilon
\end{equation}
This is the equation of a free particle with energy $E_p=E-E_0$. Hence we can model a single excited fermion as a "particle in a box" around the $\Gamma$ point for a large enough structure.

Now we consider the wavefunction of an exciton complex, which is comprised of multiple excited fermions. The interaction between the fermions is purely electromagnetic. Since the envelope functions are slowly-varying and associated to zero crystal momenta, their magnetic interaction is negligible. The magnetic interaction of the periodic basis functions gives rise to spin-orbit and orbit-orbit coupling (ignoring the hyperfine structure of spin-spin coupling), which allows us to label an exciton complex with a total angular momentum $J$ and its projection onto the $z$-axis $J_z$ as two quantum numbers. The Coulomb interaction between fermions $a$ and $b$ gives rise to a term in the Hamiltonian in the form
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a,\vec{r}_b\right)=\frac{q_aq_b}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{\abs{\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b}}
\end{equation}
This operator can be rewritten as a function of a single vector:
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{\xi}\right)=\frac{q_aq_b}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{\xi}, \qq{} \xi = \abs{\vec{\xi}}
\end{equation}
Note that when this operator acts on the full two-particle wavefunction:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coulomb_interaction_integral}
\hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)
\end{equation}
the envelope functions $\Upsilon_a, \Upsilon_b$ are slowly-varying, so we can state that they don't change in the volume of a single crystal lattice cell. Therefore, we can take the envelope functions outside of an integral where each vector $\vec{r}_a, \vec{r}_b$ is confined to a single cell:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\vec{r}_a\in \text{cell a}}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a \int_{\vec{r}_b\in \text{cell b}} \dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \approx \\
\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \int_{\vec{r}_a\in \text{cell a}}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a \int_{\vec{r}_b\in \text{cell b}} \dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
and since $U_a, U_b$ are periodic over the crystal lattice, we can denote $\xi = \vec{R}_{\text{cell b}}-\vec{R}_{\text{cell a}}$ to be the lattice vector equal to the displacement between the two cells, then the integral becomes
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{\vec{r}_a\in \text{cell a}}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a \int_{\vec{r}_b\in \text{cell b}} \dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \approx \\
\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \int_{\vec{r}_a\in \text{U.C.}}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a \int_{\vec{r}_b\in \text{U.C.}} \dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b-\vec{\xi}\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)
\end{eqnarray*}
where U.C. denotes a single unit cell of the crystal lattice centered around the origin (or otherwise fixed in space). Now comes the final approximation. When considering the integral of the expression \ref{eq:coulomb_interaction_integral} over an arbitrary dual volume, we partition the volumes into unit cells of the crystal lattice and then divide the integral into pairwise U.C.-U.C. integrals over a set of displacement vectors $\vec{\xi}$. For the majority of these vectors in dual volumes comparable in size to the size of the QD, the values of $\xi$ will be larger than the dimensions of U.C. Hence we can approximate
\begin{equation}
\hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b-\vec{\xi}\right)\approx \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{\xi}\right)
\end{equation}
By denoting the set of lattice vectors in the volume $V$ as $R_V$, the integral simplifies to
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a\int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \approx \\
\Pi_{ab} \sum_{\vec{r}_a\in R_V}\sum_{\vec{r}_b\in R_V} \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)\\
\qq{where}\Pi_{ab} = \int_{\vec{r}_a\in \text{U.C.}}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a \int_{\vec{r}_b\in \text{U.C.}} \dd^3 \vec{r}_b U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \qq{is a correlation constant.}
\end{eqnarray*}
Now we renormalize the correlation constant $\Pi_{ab}$ using the volume of the unit cell $V_{\text{U.C.}}$, which allows us to rewrite the double sum over $R_V$ as an integral over the dual volume:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a\int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_b \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)U_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)U_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) \approx\\
 \Pi'_{ab} \int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_a\int_{V}\dd^3 \vec{r}_b  \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right),\qq{where} \Pi'_{ab}=V_{\text{U.C.}}^{-2}\Pi_{ab}
 \end{eqnarray*}
 Since this must be true for any (sufficiently large) $V$, we drop the integral altogether, equating the integrands:
 \begin{equation}
 \hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right) \Psi_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Psi_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right) = \Pi'_{ab}\hat{V}_{ab}^C\left(\vec{r}_a-\vec{r}_b\right)\Upsilon_a\left(\vec{r}_a\right)\Upsilon_b\left(\vec{r}_b\right)\qq{on vol. avg.}
 \end{equation}
 What was done here was essentialy taking a volume average over the basis functions $U_a, U_b$, motivated by their periodicity over unit volumes much smaller than that of the wavefunction domain. This high-frequency periodicity manifests as a simple correlation coefficient when considering matrix elements of $\hat{V}_{ab}^C$.
 
 This allows us to modify \ref{eq:single_envelope_function} to account for Coulomb interaction purely in the paradigm of envelope functions. The full effective Schr√∂dinger equation for envelope functions (since the fine structure effects do not matter for the slowly-varying envelope functions) is then
 \begin{equation} \label{eq:exciton_envelope_equation}
 \left(-\sum_{i}\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_i^*}\nabla_{\vec{r}_i}^2 +\sum_{i,j; i\neq j} \Pi'_{ij}\hat{V}_{ij}^C\left(\vec{r}_i-\vec{r}_j\right) \right)\Upsilon = E_{\text{exciton}}\Upsilon
 \end{equation}
 where
 \begin{equation*}
 \Upsilon = \prod_{i}\Upsilon_i\left(\vec{r}_i\right)
 \end{equation*}
 Note that the Coulomb interaction on the volumes of the scale of the unit cell of the crystal lattice is fully rotationally symmetric, and therefore will not invalidate $J, J_z$ as good quantum numbers.
 
 By interpreting eq. \ref{eq:exciton_envelope_equation}, we now see that the envelope functions in an exciton complex behave as free particles in a box with added Coulomb interactions, i.e. a many-body charged particle system. Note that the potential barriers at the edges of the "box" are not infinite, and that would indeed not be a good approximation!

\subsubsection{Symmetry arguments and group theory}
Now that we have decomposed the single excited fermion wavefunction into a $j$ eigenstate periodic in the atomic lattice and a slowly varying envelope function which corresponds to a zero bulk-crystal momentum, we turn to symmetry arguments to make predictions about the spectrum. Indeed, finding either of the two component functions is a task beyond the scope of this work, but we can make quantitative statements about the
