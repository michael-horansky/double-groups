\section{Discussions of theory employed}

\subsection{The InGaAs pyramidal quantum dot} \label{sec:growth}
A brief description of the growth process as employed by Karlsson, Pelucchi etc. A discussion of \cite{hexagon} and its arguments for the true shape. A review of effects that alter the shape (and hence the symmetry) of a quantum dot, including strain and other mechanical effects.

\subsection{Exciton complexes and double groups}
A theoretical description of exciton complexes, the decomposition of their wavefunctions into a periodic function and an envelope function, and a model of the enevlope function's "effective Hamiltonian" as a box (of a non-rectangular shape) potential with particles interacting via Coulomb interaction and magnetic momenta interaction (here we justify a first-quantization approach by asserting non-relativistic effective speeds). Total angular momentum is shown to be a good quantum number and its treatment within the full rotoinversion $SU(2)\otimes C_i$ group is described.

\subsection{Photoluminiscence spectrum and evidence of symmetry elevation}
