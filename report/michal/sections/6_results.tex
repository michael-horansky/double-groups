\section{Results}

\subsection{Treatment of parity}
The theoretical treatment of parity under $l$ and $j$-coupling is shown. The program AReTDoG as an implementation of this and its agreement with \cite{karlsson} is discussed.

\subsection{Symmetry suppression theory} \label{sec:suppression}
The first-order perturbation treatment of selection rules and its applicability to low-to-high symmetry systems is shown.
