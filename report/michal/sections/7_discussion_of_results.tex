\section{Discussion of results}

%\subsection{Symmetry suppression in pyramidal quantum dots}
%The suppression theory in \ref{sec:suppression} is discussed in the context of the quantum dots grown in the mode described in \ref{sec:growth}. The limiting symmetry of the nanocrystallic structure is shown. The effects of strain and other causes of perturbation are discussed. The $C_{3v}$ probing for the $X_{\bar{1},1}$ transition is discussed and explanations are offered.
no agreement

\subsection{Agreement with $C_{6v}$ is a coincidence}
its a mathematical coincidence. C6v cannot be the group because fcc lattice. no other group agrees with experiment.

\subsection{Other hypothetical causes of symmetry elevation}
This section serves to enumerate another effects we have identified which might cause symmetry breaking or potential elevation in QDs. These include band-mixing effects and electron gas models. Since they are not mathematically developed, my goal is to identify specifically the aspects of these hypotheses that might for a basis for a change of symmetry. I also discuss why the interplay between these effects can be neglected, as that would constitute second-order effects (and I justify this claim by qualitative arguments).
