\section{Conclusions}

%The importance of \cite{hexagon} on the entire research community in the context of symmetry elevation is discussed. The treatment of parity and symmetry suppression theory are described in the perspective of their generality and other areas where they may be useful are identified. The implications of the parity treatment are discussed. I conclude that \cite{hexagon} is a satisfactory explanation for symmetry elevation, with our symmetry suppression theory justifying the dismissal of small perturbations, e.g. by mechanical means.

symmetry elevation is not a symmetry effect ater all :((
