The shape of the exciton wavefunctions is not well-understood, as calculating them is highly non-trivial. However, we can state qualitative arguments that describe the localisation of fermions in the QD approximately. For this, we will use the results from Sec. \ref{sec:envelopes} to treat the fermion envelope functions $\Upsilon_i$ as a Coulomb-interacting many-body system in a finite potential well. This highly approximate method will provide the justification for our expectation of some excitons being highly localised in the bulk of the QD.

Firstly, for a single particle in a finite potential well, we shall inquire on the role of the effective mass $m^*$ in the tunnelling of the wavefunction into the edges of the well, which probes the structure symmetry. As shown e.g. by Landau in \cite[p. 64]{landau}, the attenuation coefficient is proportional to $\sqrt{m^*}$ for $1$D wells. This result is readily generalised for $3$D systems of arbitrary shape, since in the region outside the well, the SchrÃ¶dinger equation has the form
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{\hat{p}}{\sqrt{2m^*}}\right)^2\ket{\Upsilon} = (E-V)\ket{\Upsilon}
\end{equation}
where $V>E$ is the depth of the potential well, larger than the particle energy, since the particle is constrained within the QD. We see that the sign of $E-V$ is negative. Since the particle is free in the regime outside of the potential well, we expect it to be (approximately) an eigenfunction of $\hat{p}$ as well as $\hat{H}$, especially if the shape of the potential well boundary in three dimensions is smooth. Then the eigenvalue of $\hat{p}$ must be purely imaginary to match the sign on both sides, and proportional to $\sqrt{m^*}$ for the attenuation coefficient in the spatial dependence to be of dimension $\unit{m}^{-1}$. This allows us to conclude that fermions with high effective mass (such as heavy holes with $m^*_{hh}\approx 0.5m_e$) will be more strongly localised in the centre of the QD bulk than fermions with low effective mass (such as electrons with $m^*_e\approx 0.059m_e$ and light holes with $m^*_{lh}\approx 0.076m_e$). \textit{Note.} The effective masses were calculated for $\text{In}_{0.10}\text{Ga}_{0.90}\text{As}$ with the formulas provided by Goldberg and Schmidt in \cite[p. 62]{semiconductor_handbook}. These formulas are stated for $T=\SI{300}{\kelvin}$, but we do not expect the effective masses to vary between $T=\SI{30}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{300}{\kelvin}$ significantly for this qualitative argumentation, as the fact that $m_e^*$ and $m_{lh}^*$ are of the same order of magnitude and $m_{hh}^*$ is larger by an order of magnitude should remain true. This leads us to a hypothesis that single light holes and single electrons probe the structure symmetry, but single heavy holes are localised in the centre of the QD and undergo symmetry elevation to the bulk symmetry.

If we occupy the QD with two or more excited fermions of the same type, the total Hamiltonian will be invariant under exchanging any two of them, which implies a symmetry in the magnitude of $\Upsilon_i$ (the full spinor wavefunction, naturally, will be antisymmetric under exchange of two indistinguishable particles). This means every single particle in the equal-type fermionic complex either probes the structury symmetry or is localised in the centre. This means that multiple light holes and multiple electrons should both probe the structure symmetry under our previous assumptions, and we hypothesise that multiple heavy holes are still localised in the centre.

If we mix excited fermions of different types into exciton complex, we can now see the logical conclusions of our hypothesis. In excitons with only light holes, both the light holes and the excitons probe the structure symmetry and their Coulomb attraction does not affect that. In excitons with both light and heavy holes, the light holes still probe the structure symmetry, a phenomenon reinforced by their Coulomb repulsion with the centrally-localised heavy holes, which may push the light holes further out into the edges of the QD. Finally, in excitons with purely heavy holes, the Coulomb attraction between the heavy holes and the electrons increases the probability of measuring the electrons near the centre of the QD. Hence only purely heavy hole-like excitons undergo symmetry elevation to the bulk symmetry and enjoy symmetry suppression effects in this model.

\textit{Note.} Since the shape of the envelope functions is not known, the fact that pure-light hole excitons probe the structure symmetry is empirical in our model.
