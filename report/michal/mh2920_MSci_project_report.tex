\section{Abstract}
We investigate the photoluminiscence spectra of InGaAs pyramidal quantum dots with a triangular base under exciton decay. We employ an envelope-function treatment for the exciton wavefunctions, deriving the envelope effective Hamiltonian at the $\Gamma$ point. We review the principles of arguments based on Hamiltonian symmetries in group-theory formalism, specifically the predictions they provide for energy level degeneracies and the selection rules for transitions induced by weak perturbation. We review the claim made by Karlsson \textit{et al.} (2015) that pyramidal quantum dots with triangular base (symmetry group $C_{3v}$) exhibit laser-induced photoluminiscence spectra characteristic of structures with a higher symmetry (symmetry group $D_{3h}$). We propose a theoretical model based on first-order perturbations to symmetry selection rules as a possible mechanism for symmetry elevation, and the condition of localisation within the quantum dot bulk which the model imposes on the wavefunction of an exciton that undergoes symmetry elevation. We claim that exciton complexes with equal charge and equal number of electrons are more likely to undergo symmetry elevation when they are dominated by heavy holes. Because the crystal lattice in the quantum dot restricts the true Hamiltonian symmetries, we claim that $D_{3h}$ is not a candidate of the elevated symmetry group within our model, and we identify $T_d$ as the only possible candidate symmetry group if no \textit{a priori} symmetry breaking is postulated. We compare the predictions $T_d$ yields to both the data measured by Karlsson \textit{et al.} and a new dataset provided by our colleagues, finding good agreement for a part of the studied sample for several exciton complexes. We review the condition of raising valence band degeneracy at $\Gamma$ which elevating to $T_d$ requires, and which is not treated within our proposed model. We discuss further analysis of elevation to bulk symmetry in nanocrystals, as well as the exciton transformation properties disregarded in our simplistic model.

\section{Introduction}

Quantum dots (QDs) have been the subject of keen interest and study by the scientific community in the last decades for their wide applications in quantum information \cite{quantum_information1}, photonics \cite{photonics1, photonics2}, medicine \cite{medicine1, medicine2}, and many others \cite{other_applications}. Many of these applications are viable due to the unique electronic properties of QDs that allow us to construct within it atom-like electron states \cite{atomlike} with tunable energy levels \cite{tunable} which depend on the specific manufacturing parameters. However, there are still challenges in characterising the small-scale structural properties of grown QDs, such as unintentional symmetry breaking \cite{karlsson}. In the project, we will inspect these structural properties using the tools of spectroscopy and the mathematical toolset of group theory.

Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals \cite{other_applications}, which enjoy programmable charge states of electrons and electron holes (together dubbed exciton complexes) \cite{charge_state}. The most direct way to experimentally investigate the energy states of electrons and electron holes in QDs is photoluminiscence spectroscopy, a technique used by Karlsson \textit{et al.} \cite{karlsson}. The QDs are first non-resonantly excited by a laser and then spontaneously emit photons due to state transitions of exciton complexes. Each exciton complex may correspond to multiple tightly-spaced energy levels. Determining these energy levels, as well as the selection rules that rule which transitions between them are allowed, is then sufficient to describe the QD spectrum.

The energy level splitting for exciton complexes can be investigated by first considering the exciton as a state of multiple fermionic particles which couple their total angular momenta, and then inserting these eigenstates of total angular momentum into the structure of the quantum dot, breaking the rotational symmetry. Whilst the exciton wavefunctions are very difficult to calculate precisely, we can use symmetry arguments to determine the number of distinct energy levels and their degeneracies for a single exciton complex, as well as the selection rules for transitions between energy levels belonging to two different exciton complexes. For this, we use group theory, which proved to be very useful in quantum mechanics and other branches of physics in the twentieth century thanks to the work of physicists such as Eugene Wigner and Hermann Weyl \cite{wightman}. In our problem, we describe the symmetry of a QD by its \textit{group of the Hamiltonian}, which is constructed from the set of all rotations and roto-inversions which commute with the Hamiltonian that governs exciton complexes.

In 2015, Karlsson \textit{et al.} published a paper claiming that InGaAs QDs grown in a way which suggests its group of the Hamiltonian should be $C_{3v}$ exhibits spectral features for certain exciton transitions which imply the group of the Hamiltonian to contain more symmetries, corresponding to $D_{3h}$ or $C_{6v}$ \cite{karlsson}. The effect of \textit{symmetry elevation} has been studied by Karlsson \textit{et al.} in \cite{karlsson} and \cite{karlsson_2010} and by Dupertuis \textit{et al.} in \cite{dupertuis}, but remains yet unexplained. In this work, we collaborate with a laboratory at Tyndall Institute, University College Cork, which reproduces the spectral measurements for this type of QDs using new methods of spectral features identification, and compare these measurements to our simple perturbative model of \textit{symmetry suppression} which attempts to quantify the effects of approximate symmetries, which were hypothesised by Dupertuis \textit{et al.} as the mechanism behind symmetry elevation \cite[p. 2]{dupertuis}. Finally, we reject the suggested groups $D_{3h}$ and $C_{6v}$ as candidates for symmetry elevation due to them postulating symmetries which the underlying atomic lattice of the QD is not equipped with. Instead, we identify $T_d$ as the \textit{bulk symmetry} of this lattice, and propose it as a new candidate for symmetry elevation.


\subsection{The InGaAs pyramidal quantum dot} \label{sec:growth}

 \caption{The tetrahedral recesses within which the QDs are grown. Dashed lines indicate the pyramid boundaries before growth, the solid lines indicate the vicinal facets after growth. "VQWR" refers to the vertical quantum wire present in the structure. Recess figure taken from \cite[Fig. 1]{pyramidal_qds}; QD structure diagram taken from \cite[Fig. 1]{karlsson}\label{fig:pyramidal_qds}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The quantum dot bulk is an $\text{In}_{0.10}\text{Ga}_{0.90}\text{As}$ alloy semiconductor, and the dot is grown in tetrahedral recesses on a GaAs $\{111\}B$ substrate. Within the tetrahedral recess, three quantum wires form along the pyramid corners, and a quantum dot forms at the tip of the pyramid where the quantum wires meet \cite{pyramidal_qds}. As seen in Fig. \ref{fig:pyramidal_qds}, the shape of the recess should determine the symmetries of the dot. The triangular base yields the three-fold rotation along the $z$-axis, and the inclination of the facets breaks the $z$-mirror symmetry. However, as seen by the deformation of the facets, the true shape of the dot is affected by several phenomena, some of which are poorly understood. For instance, Holsgrove \textit{et al.} have studied a similar quantum dot which significantly differs only in the thickness of the lateral quantum wires, and have found the dot to form the shape of a regular hexagon, which does possess $C_{6v}$ symmetry \cite{hexagon} (see Fig. \ref{fig:hexagonal_qds}). We do not believe that our dot also forms a regular hexagon, and even in such case the true symmetry would be limited by the underlying lattice, hence disconfirming $C_{6v}$ as the group towards which symmetry elevates, but this illustrates that the true shape of the QD is poorly understood, and might exhibit properties which allow approximate symmetries to manifest.

Dupertuis \textit{et al.} claim that symmetry elevation manifests in strain-free QDs \cite[p. 4]{dupertuis}, and hence we disregard strain effects and symmetry breaking possibly caused by them in our analysis, and we discuss the possible effects of strain on our models in Sec. \ref{sec:symmetry_outside_gamma} and Sec. \ref{sec:conclusions}.

The measurements were conducted by our colleagues Francesco Mattana, Luca Colavecchi, Gediminas Juska and Emanuele Pelucchi (Tyndall National Institute, University College Cork). The data will be published together with the experimental details and descriptions of the methods they used to identify emission lines with the exciton transitions they correspond to in a separate paper, and therefore we omit this information here. Mattana, Colavecchi, Juska, and Pelucchi have kindly provided us with their results regarding the spectral features of individual exciton decays, which we use to test our theoretical model in Sec. \ref{sec:testing_against_data}.
