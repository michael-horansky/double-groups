\section{Abstract}

In this project, we investigate the photonic properties of quantum dots employing a group-theoretical description of first-order perturbation theory. Experimental data from polarisation resolved photoluminiscence spectroscopy are investigated using the theory of exciton complexes and group theory. The major features of the spectral diagrams can be labelled by exciton state transitions immediately by considering the total angular momentum coupling of these exciton complexes. These major features also exhibit splitting caused by crystallographic symmetry breaking. The transitions between said energy levels are subject to symmetry selection rules, and we attempt to quantify the rates of these transitions by considering approximate symmetries. A list of other effects that may cause symmetry elevation is stated and reviewed.

\section{Introduction}

Firstly, a historical context of the problem and a brief literature review (namely \cite{karlsson}). Secondly, a brief review of \cite{hexagon} as a \textit{de facto} solution to symmetry elevation, and then motivating the need for a perturbative analysis under strain and imperfect growth, which favour the three pyramid-defined directions out of the six grown. Thirdly, a list of proposed solutions, with the first one, a perturbative model of a low-symmetry Hamiltonian being mathematically explored and quantified.
