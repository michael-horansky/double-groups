-Section content should be immediately obvious from the label ("what's the differentce between GT in QM I and GT in QM II?")
-Section labels might be more neutral (i would drop the hitchiker's guide, save that for the layperson's summary)

-You do say that reducible representations can be formed by direct sums/products of smaller reps, but maybe also talk about the decomposition, e.g. mention orthogonality of character vectors in the group element space as I did, otherwise sentences such as "this rep contains the identity rep" are a bit abstract? idk, i mean technically not an issue.
- in 2.2.2, maybe mention specifically Fermi's golden rule,, because that's where the matrix element comes from
- in 2.2.3 you're using the wrong notation for exciton complexes!!!! the number n before X is not the number of electrons, but the number of electron-hole pairs (e.g. 3 electrons and 2 heavy holes would be 2X^-_20). This is why the charge label is important, as it specifies extra electrons. You can think of n as the possible number of recombinations before hitting a stable state.

2.3.2
-Transforms as SU(2) _under rotations_.

4.1
-You claim that symmetry suppression theory predicts that for a light hole and heavy hole, the light hole would be pushed out to the boundary, probing the structure symmetry. This was our paradigm a month ago. In my analysis, I claim that this is no longer a justifiable claim, as the particles-in-a-box model can only say that less heavy holes = more likely to probe structure symmetry. This is not a problem with your report, but an important difference. (In some sense, your suppression conjecture is stronger than mine.)
-You talk about 2X^+_20. That's not a real exciton. Did you mean X^+_20? If yes, its behaviour doesn't say anything about the behaviour of 2X_20

4.4.2
-I suggest you mention the problem of exact degeneracy of heavy and light hole bands at Gamma for T_d! This is probably the biggest shortcoming of symmetry suppression theory. See my Sec. 6.3 for details.

Either in Results or Conclusions, you should talk about how even in the Karlsson data, the C_3v-agreeing predictions constitute only about 15% of the sample. The Conclusions makes the problem look solved, but it really isn't, especially with how noisy and inconsistent the readings are.

-Appendix C is really, really similar to my Section 4.1. Now, since the work is shared in this project, that is not a problem, but any plagiarism software will pick up on that. I suggest you specifically acknowledge at the beginning of Appendix C me and my report as a source of this derivation (especially for the envelope-effectove hamiltonian and the particles-in-the-box model). Alternatively, just state the results (slowly varying envelopes with lattice-periodic modulation, charged-particles-in-a-box), crediting Burt and Zhang respectively.
-Same for the symmetry suppression sections in 3.4. Now, ofc there is only one "correct" theoretical derivation of suppression, but since it is directly text contained within the report, i think it will make you look better if you put an ackonwledgement at the top of the section that the following derivation was authored by me, since i quote the original derivation verbatim in my report.

        the eqnarray shouldn't have a different equation number for each line break!
    
    General:
        -i saw some "don't"s etc, make sure to write them out as "do not"s etc, since contractions are not academic writing style.
