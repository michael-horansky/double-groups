This document aims to track that content in chapters leading up to Chapter 16 which are relevant for understanding of Chapter 16, from the perspective of
someone who has finished Dmitri's Group Theory module (aka DGT).

Chapter 1
    All already covered in DGT except
        -1.7 Factor group (NOT RELEVANT)

Chapter 2
    All already covered in DGT

Chapter 3
    All already covered in DGT except for
        -3.4 Reducible Representations is more elaborate than the 2022/23 course
        -3.9 Symmetry Notation (RELEVANT)

Chapter 4
    -4.1, 4.2 touched upon in DGT, but greatly elaborated on here (RELEVANT)
    -the entire rest of the chapter (4.3 - 4.6) focuses on projection operators and basis functions (RELEVANT)

Chapter 5
    -All touched upon in DGT, but recommended heavily since I found it more concise than Dmitri's lecture notes.

Chapter 6
    -This is an example of the application of general principles derived in previous chapters, but I found it extremely
        insightful and easy to work through - RELEVANT

Chapter 7
    -All covered in DGT, but explained here with much greater clarity, with an exceptionally well-worked example.

Chapter 8
    -Application of GT to molecular bonding - NOT RELEVANT

Chapter 9
    -Application of GT to vibrational modes - NOT RELEVANT

Chapter 10
    -Discussion of "equivalence" (a situation when the wavefunctions of two particles are interchangable without affecting the Hamiltonian)
        and the application of permutation groups to multi-electron orbitals of a single atom. Interesting but NOT RELEVANT(?)

Chapter 11
    -Discussion of abstract tensor algebra, where a GT approach yields neat results. NOT RELEVANT(?)
