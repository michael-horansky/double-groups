This document aims to track that content in chapters leading up to Chapter 16 which are relevant for understanding of Chapter 19, from the perspective of
someone who has finished Dmitri's Group Theory module (aka DGT).

Chapter 1
    All already covered in DGT except
        -1.7 Factor group (NOT RELEVANT)

Chapter 2
    All already covered in DGT

Chapter 3
    All already covered in DGT except for
        -3.4 Reducible Representations is more elaborate than the 2022/23 course
        -3.9 Symmetry Notation (RELEVANT)

Chapter 4
    -4.1, 4.2 touched upon in DGT, but greatly elaborated on here (RELEVANT)
    -the entire rest of the chapter (4.3 - 4.6) focuses on projection operators and basis functions (RELEVANT)

Chapter 5
    -All touched upon in DGT, but recommended heavily since I found it more concise than Dmitri's lecture notes.

Chapter 6
    -This is an example of the application of general principles derived in previous chapters, but I found it extremely
        insightful and easy to work through - RELEVANT

Chapter 7
    -All covered in DGT, but explained here with much greater clarity, with an exceptionally well-worked example.

Chapter 8
    -Application of GT to molecular bonding - NOT RELEVANT

Chapter 9
    -Application of GT to vibrational modes - NOT RELEVANT

Chapter 10
    -Discussion of "equivalence" (a situation when the wavefunctions of two particles are interchangable without affecting the Hamiltonian)
        and the application of permutation groups to multi-electron orbitals of a single atom. Interesting but NOT RELEVANT(?)

Chapter 11
    -Discussion of abstract tensor algebra, where a GT approach yields neat results. NOT RELEVANT(?)

Chapter 12
    -Unlike the previous 6 chapters, this chapter doesn't showcase a specific application of GT to a physical problem, but rather
        builds the notation of space groups (rotation + translation symmetry) and lists point group symmetries of all bravais lattices. NOT RELEVANT
    -Can be useful in case we need to familiarise ourselves with the International Crystallography Tables notation.

Chapter 13
    -Applies space groups to a real physical problem (Proof of Bloch's Theorem)
    -Discusses the group of the wavevector (point subgroup of the group of symmetries of the reciprocal lattice/crystal structure)
    -Band degeneracies and compatibility relations
    -All in all NOT RELEVANT (?)

Chapter 14
    -Uses results from Chapter 13 to analyse the degeneracies of band diagrams at k=0, and mode analysis of lattice vibrations.

Chapter 15
    -Supplement to Ch14

Chapter 16
    How to draw band structure diagrams
