\subsection{The relationship between the Hilbert space of the Hamiltonian and the minimal Hilbert space of its symmetry group}
	
	Studying a non-interacting spinless particle in a spherically symmetric potential, an interesting phenomenon emerges. The Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ is an operator on some Hilbert space. This operator must be able to act on each eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, and we could consider the smallest Hilbert space which can contain $\hat{H}$ to be the one spanned by all of these eigenstates. For example, the single non-interacting spinless particle in a spherically symmetric potential has a Hamiltonian which can be written in terms of the angular momentum operator $\hat{L}$ and some radial part that is not of interest to us right now. Therefore the Hamiltonian can be emplyed as an operator on a Hilbert space spanned by angular momentum eigenstates $\ket{l,m}$, which coincides with the minimal Hilbert space of $SO(3)$. However, we have shown that the group of this Hamiltonian is $O(3)$, and thus its minimal Hilbert space is larger. The smallest Hilbert space $\hat{H}$ can act on is a subspace of the minimal Hilbert space of the symmetry group of $\hat{H}$!
	
	These two Hilbert spaces would coincide if $\hat{H}$ gained a term dependent on $\hat{i}$, which would break the "accidental" symmetry between irreps of $O(3)$ that only differ in parity. However, it is a profound result that even though $\hat{H}$ can be an operator acting on the minimal Hilbert space of $SO(3)$, its full symmetry group implies another set of eigenstates which become important when e.g. interaction terms that couple two particles' angular momenta is introduced.
	
	It is important to note that the minimal Hilbert space isn't always a superspace of the smallest Hilbert space the Hamiltonian needs to act on. This is because we specifically omit eigenstates in the minimal Hilbert space of the symmetry group if they form repeated bases of a single irrep. For the continuous groups treated in this article--$SO(3),O(3),SU(2),SU(2)\otimes C_i$, we find there are no repeated bases, in which case that ordering holds. However, in the general case, and typically for finite point groups, to construct the smallest Hilbert that contains all the possible eigenstates of the Hamiltonian that can be reached by coupling of quantum numbers, one needs to find the smallest Hilbert spaces of which
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item the smallest Hilbert space the operators in the Hamiltonian can be embedded in
	\item the minimal Hilbert space of the group of the Hamiltonian
	\end{enumerate}
	are both subspaces. \textit{Note}: in both conditions, the Hamiltonian means including coupling term, since that may in general affect both the quantum numbers labelling the Hamiltonian eigenstates as well as the group of the Hamiltonian.
